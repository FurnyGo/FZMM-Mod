### Useful block states

A list of items that I think can be useful or at least curious/fun, these items have a tag called [BlockStateTag](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_states) that modifies their properties when placed.

### Loot chests

All types of loot chest, or in other words: a list of chests which each time you open one for the first time has a different loot and all the chests there have different odds and items.

### Player heads

A list of heads of all connected players.
